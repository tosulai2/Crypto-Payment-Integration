# Crypto-Payment-Integration

UC Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 19 Module 19 Challenge assignment for the UC Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp.

In this challenge, I built a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. 

I integrated the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

## Technologies

This project uses Python programming language, dataclasses for the block/transaction records, python's web3 library, bip44 standard, os env library, ganaches ethereum testnet and a streamlit library and functions associated to display online, etc.
